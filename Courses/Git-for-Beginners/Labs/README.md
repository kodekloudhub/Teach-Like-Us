## During the Labs

While working on the labs, keep the following in mind:

- **Take Notes**: Jot down any challenges you face, how you overcome them, and any insights you gain. This will enhance your learning experience.
- **Don't Rush**: The goal of the labs is not just to complete them but to understand the concepts being applied. Take your time to explore and experiment.

## After Completing the Labs

Upon completing the labs, consider the following actions to consolidate your learning:

- **Reflect on Your Experience**: Think about what you learned during the lab. How do the concepts apply to real-world scenarios?
- **Discuss Your Insights**: If you're learning as part of a group or class, share your experiences and insights with your peers. Discussion can further deepen your understanding.
